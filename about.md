Hey fellas, I am Nayaabkhan-Khan. Yea Khan is twice. I am from India and work as a Frontend developer and Team lead at
[StarOfService](http://www.starofservice.com). My work has led me to learn a lot about frontend and designing.
I decided to share my experiences with the world and so fired up this blog.

I love React and would try to share my experiences of using React. I also love DIY, would blog about that too. If all that sounds cool to you then you should subscribe to my blog's newletter (coming real soon, before a 110 new JS frameworks show up). Pinky promise, no SPAMs.

Cheers!
