		<strong>Additional</strong>: <br />
		- Stems*: + $10 <br />
		- Project Files (REAPER 6 .RPP)**: + $20
	</p>
	<p>
		- <strong>Stems</strong> are multi-track render of each instrument of the
		project. Useful if you want to mix the instrumental yourself or by your
		mixing engineer. <br />
		- <strong>Project File</strong> is in .RPP format produced using REAPER 6
		(<a href="http://reaper.fm/">http://reaper.fm/</a>) and may use additional
		3rd party plugins. All tracks are frozen so you can playback & listen the
		project without any problems and you can unfreeze every track if needed.
		Please make sure you have all the required plugins installed before
		unfreezing. Plugin list will be included as well.
	</p>

	<h2>Payment</h2>
	<p>
		Prices are in USD and currently I can only accept PayPal. My payment policy
		is 50% of the total project cost in advance, and 50% upon completion, where
		you would then receive your finished track.
	</p>

		Please contact/DM if youâ€™re interested or have any question :)

	<h2>Policy</h2>
	<p>
		You can use the instrumental commission for anything commercial or
		non-commercial along with your cover or as a BGM or any creative works. But,
		please note that I retain all the rights to any music that I
		arranged/produced as a commission. So redistributing the instrumental track
		only (as it is) is prohibited, unless other terms are agreed upon.
